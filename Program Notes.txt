Things this Program does:

1. Has preset "bank accounts" that have preset account numbers and PINs. Every account has a random amount set.
2. User enters account number and corresponding PIN to access the account.
  a. Accounts have sub-accounts. ie. Checking, Saving, etc.
3. User selects a sub-account and is asked about what kind of transaction he/she wants.
  a. User has option to withdraw, deposit, etc.
 4. When a transaction is selected, the program uses a function to comply with the user's request and performes the task.
 5. User is asked if they need another transaction or if not, the user has an option to quit.
  a. The user is taken back to the sub-account screen, user can select other account or choose to quit.
 6. If user quits, then the program goes back to initial screen asking for account number and PIN.
 7. Program uses lots of "try and catch" methods to make sure the program does not end in error if user enters wrong account name/pin or
    makes a wrong choice.
 
 
 Things to improve:
 
 1. The length of the code is too long. Need to shorten the code.
 2. The Account and PIN are in a vector and we know their locations in the vector. Program would be more effecient if we could traverse
    through the vector looking for account numbers and their corresponding PINs.
 3. The program has no way to add more account number/pins.
 4.
